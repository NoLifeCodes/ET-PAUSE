	ET-PAUSE is an open source Etterna Pausing tool for osu mania nerds who don't have stamina and CAN'T jack 200 bpm (skill issue tbh)üòí

This Project was made with ChatGPT AND IS !!!!!! EXPERIMENTAL !!!!!! (he helped with formatting, and all the stuff with "#'s" are the functions he helped with) 
mainly the beeping, quit function (that may be broken) and culling since before he helped at all the key checking function was fucked
I am pro coder and i do not take responsibility if your retarded ass gets banned for using it online :D (not my issue btw)
this is a tool TO HAVE FUN and is NOT meant to be ABUSED

If you are "SCARED"üòÆ (fucking pussy) of using it DON'T!!, plain and simple JUST DON'T, this was made for my friend since his stamina was shit and he complained about his upper arms

burning whilst playing jack (sorry stouts)

@# 
IF YOU KEEP THE GAME PAUSED FOR TOO LONG AND press KEYS or TAB OUT CONSTANTLY ! Your game will crash (not my issue either!)üòéüòé
@# 
this was made so these osu mania players can have a go at playing etterna without whining about stamina  ‚ò†Ô∏è
